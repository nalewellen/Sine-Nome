## ETFs

This file contains the R code for ETF registration and ETF filing word count analysis. 

Outstanding items:

* The data needs to be stored in csv files that can be appended to track history and changes. 
* The csv files will then be written to an Excel document.
* The Excel document will serve as a start for formaing a unstructured indicator database. 

## Technicals

This file contains the R code for stock data and technical indicators.

### RSI

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is calculated in the techs.r file. That file also includes a Buy/Sell signal. 

* The Buy / Sell indicator needs a little work after additional updates. 

## Database

This pushes the R dataframes to a local DB to store and archive unstructured data. 

## Functions

This file stores the core functions used between each program to keep the code condensed and clean between programs. 

## Visualization 

This file will eventually store the raw code to generate core visualizations.
